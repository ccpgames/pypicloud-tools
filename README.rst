Tools to bypass a PyPICloud installation and communicate directly with
S3

Utilities
---------

Upload
~~~~~~

Uploads file(s) to the PyPICloud S3 bucket directly and performs an
admin API call to rebuild the PyPICloud index after.

Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ upload dist/*
    Uploading example-project/example-project-0.0.1.tar.gz ..... done!
    Uploading example-project/example_project-0.0.1-py2-none-any.whl ..... done!
    Uploading example-project/example_project-0.0.1-py2.7.egg ...... done!
    PyPICloud server at http://your.pypicloud.server/pypi updated

It's fine if the file names use altering hypens/underscores per release type
like you see above, they only need to match the initial part of the key before
the ``/`` to be considered the same package.

Download
~~~~~~~~

Downloads the latest or a specific version directly from S3. Does not
talk to PyPICloud and does not install the downloaded package. You can
use pip to do either/both of those things.

Also possible with the download command is the ``--url`` flag to only
print a download URL (usable for 5 minutes).

By default, if there are multiple releases of the same package+release,
download will prefer wheels, then eggs, then source distributions. You
can override that behavior with the ``--egg`` and ``--src`` flags.

Examples:

.. code:: bash

    $ download example_project==0.0.1
    example_project-0.0.1-py2-none-any.whl

.. code:: bash

    $ download example-project --egg
    example_project-0.0.1-py2.7.egg

Pipes and redirects work like you'd expect:

.. code:: bash

    $ download example_project --src | tar -xzf -

List
~~~~

Lists a package's releases, or releases of a package at a specific
version. Again, talks straight to S3 and bypasses the PyPICloud
installation.

Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ list example_project
    example-project==0.0.1 : example-project-0.0.1.tar.gz
    example-project==0.0.1 : example_project-0.0.1-py2.7.egg
    example-project==0.0.1 : example_project-0.0.1-py2-none-any.whl

Listing multiple packages or packages with a version specifier is also
supported.

When called without any arguments, ``list`` will display all known
packages.

Rehost
~~~~~~

Rehosts an upstream package from PyPI into the pypicloud installation.
This can be handy if you have pypicloud clients which only have access
to it and s3 but not the rest of the internet.

Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ rehost requests==1.0.0
    Collecting requests==1.0.0
      Downloading requests-1.0.0.tar.gz (335kB)
        100% |████████████████████████████████| 335kB 929kB/s
      Saved /var/folders/53/kl4v4_9509ng148kp_pwmc5h0000gn/T/tmpuj5JUJ/requests-1.0.0.tar.gz
    Successfully downloaded requests
    Uploading requests/requests-1.0.0.tar.gz ............ done!
    PyPICloud server at http://your_pypicloud_server/pypi updated

If a specific version is not provided, the latest will be used. Multiple
packages can be used in the same command.

Installation
------------

Simple
~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pypicloud-tools

From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/ccpgames/pypicloud-tools.git
    $ cd pypicloud-tools
    $ python setup.py install

Configuration
-------------

Configuration for pypicloud-tools piggybacks on your ``~/.pypirc`` file.
You can specify an alternate config file with the ``--config`` flag, but
it must be in the same syntax. That syntax is:

.. code:: text

    [pypicloud]
        repository:http://your.pypicloud.server/pypi
        username:admin
        password:hunter7
        bucket:your_bucket
        access:some_key
        secret:other_key
        acl:optional_acl
        region:optional_region

The key **must** be ``pypicloud``, it is the only key pypicloud-tools
will look at. The username/password combination should have admin
credentials on the PyPICloud installation as it needs to call
``/admin/rebuild`` after a succesful upload.
